🔄 Kafka Consumer Service Integration with Backend (Node.js)
📌 Overview
The Kafka consumer service is designed to consume messages from Apache Kafka topics, process them, and integrate with the backend business logic. This architecture is ideal for event-driven systems, real-time data processing, and microservices communication.

🧱 Architecture Components

Kafka Broker: Manages topics and message distribution.
Kafka Consumer Service (Node.js): Listens to specific topics and processes incoming messages.
Backend Service: Contains business logic, database operations, and APIs.


🛠️ Implementation Details
1. Kafka Consumer Setup (Node.js)

   const { Kafka } = require('kafkajs');

const kafka = new Kafka({
  clientId: 'feedback-consumer',
  brokers: ['kafka-broker1:9092', 'kafka-broker2:9092']
});

const consumer = kafka.consumer({ groupId: 'feedback-group' });

async function startConsumer() {
  await consumer.connect();
  await consumer.subscribe({ topic: 'feedback-topic', fromBeginning: false });

  await consumer.run({
    eachMessage: async ({ topic, partition, message }) => {
      const payload = JSON.parse(message.value.toString());
      console.log(`Received message:`, payload);

      // Call backend service logic
      await processFeedback(payload);
    }
  });
}

startConsumer();
``

2. Integration with Backend Service
The consumer service calls internal backend functions or APIs to process the data:

async function processFeedback(payload) {
  // Example: Save feedback to MongoDB
  await FeedbackModel.create({
    userId: payload.userId,
    rating: payload.rating,
    comment: payload.comment,
    timestamp: payload.timestamp
  });

  // Optionally trigger other services (e.g., notifications)
}

The backend service may be part of the same Node.js app or exposed via internal APIs.
Use service layer abstraction to keep consumer logic clean and maintainable.


🔒 Security & Reliability

Use SSL/TLS for Kafka broker communication.
Enable consumer group rebalancing for scalability.
Implement retry logic and dead-letter queues for failed messages.
Monitor with Prometheus + Grafana or CloudWatch (if on MSK).


📈 Use Case Example
In a feedback collection system:

Users submit feedback via frontend.

Feedback is published to feedback-topic.

Kafka consumer service processes the message and stores it in MongoDB.

Backend triggers analytics or notifications based on feedback.
