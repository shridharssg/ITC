Can you describe the Kafka consumer service you implemented, and how it integrates with the backend service containing it?

How do you configure a message queue (e.g., visibility timeout, execution time, etc.)?

Apart from SQS and Kafka, what other message queue systems have you worked with?

Why would you choose Kafka over SQS?

How would you design a batch processing system using Amazon SQS? Please explain your error handling strategy, including the use of Dead-Letter Queues (DLQ).
