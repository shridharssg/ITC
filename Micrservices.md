**Ques : What is the role of an API Gateway in a microservices architecture?**

üåê Role of API Gateway in Microservices Architecture
An API Gateway acts as a single entry point for clients to interact with multiple microservices. It simplifies communication, enhances security, and improves scalability in distributed systems.

**‚úÖ Key Responsibilities of API Gateway**


**Request Routing**

Routes incoming HTTP requests to the appropriate microservice based on the URL path or method.
Example: /orders ‚Üí Order Service, /users ‚Üí User Service.



**Authentication & Authorization**

Validates tokens (e.g., JWT) and integrates with services like AWS Cognito or OAuth providers.
Ensures only authorized users can access specific endpoints.



**Rate Limiting & Throttling**

Prevents abuse by limiting the number of requests per user/IP.

Helps protect backend services from overload.



**Caching**

Caches responses for frequently accessed endpoints to reduce latency and backend load.

Example: Product catalog or static content.



**Request Transformation**

Modifies headers, query parameters, or payloads before forwarding to microservices.

Useful for versioning or protocol translation.



**Response Aggregation**

Combines responses from multiple microservices into a single response.
Example: Dashboard API that pulls data from orders, users, and inventory services.



**Monitoring & Logging**

Tracks request metrics, errors, and latency.

Integrates with AWS CloudWatch, X-Ray, or third-party tools.


**Security**

Acts as a firewall for microservices.

Supports SSL termination, IP whitelisting, and DDoS protection via AWS WAF.




**üöÄ Benefits in Microservices Architecture**

Decouples clients from microservices: Clients don‚Äôt need to know internal service URLs.

Centralized control: Easier to manage policies, authentication, and logging.

Improved scalability: Offloads common tasks from microservices.

Simplified client experience: One endpoint for all services.


**üõ†Ô∏è Example in AWS**
Using Amazon API Gateway with AWS Lambda or ECS:

- API Gateway receives a request at /orders.

- Authenticates via Cognito.
  
- Routes to Lambda function or ECS service.
  
- Logs request in CloudWatch.
  
- Returns response to client.

**Ques : When should 4xx and 5xx HTTP status codes be used in REST API design?**

When to Use 4xx and 5xx HTTP Status Codes in REST API Design
Proper use of HTTP status codes helps clients understand the result of their requests and improves API reliability and debugging.

**‚úÖ 4xx ‚Äì Client Error Responses**
Use these when the client has made a mistake in the request.


**400 Bad Request**
The request is malformed or contains invalid parameters (e.g., missing required fields, invalid JSON).


**401 Unauthorized**
The client is not authenticated (e.g., missing or invalid token).


**403 Forbidden**
The client is authenticated but does not have permission to access the resource.


**404 Not Found**
The requested resource does not exist (e.g., invalid endpoint or ID).


**405 Method Not Allowed**
The HTTP method used is not supported by the endpoint (e.g., POST on a GET-only route).


**409 Conflict**
The request conflicts with the current state of the resource (e.g., duplicate entries, versioning issues).


**422 Unprocessable Entity**
The request is syntactically correct but semantically invalid (e.g., validation errors, business rule violations).



**‚úÖ 5xx ‚Äì Server Error Responses**
Use these when the server fails to process a valid request due to internal issues.


**500 Internal Server Error**
A generic error indicating something went wrong on the server (e.g., unhandled exceptions).


**502 Bad Gateway**
The server received an invalid response from an upstream service (e.g., API Gateway ‚Üí Lambda failure).


**503 Service Unavailable**
The server is temporarily unable to handle the request (e.g., maintenance, overload).


**504 Gateway Timeout**
The upstream service did not respond in time (e.g., Lambda or DB timeout).


**üõ†Ô∏è Best Practices**

- Return structured error responses with helpful messages.

- Avoid exposing internal stack traces or sensitive details.

- Log all 5xx errors for monitoring and debugging.

- Use consistent error formats (e.g., JSON with code, message, and details).

**Ques : What is microservice-based architecture and have you used it?**

**üß± What is Microservice-Based Architecture?** : 
Microservice architecture is a design pattern where an application is broken down into a collection of small, loosely coupled, independently deployable services. Each service is responsible for a specific business capability and communicates with other services via APIs (typically REST or messaging queues).

**‚úÖ Key Characteristics**


**Independent Deployment**
Each microservice can be deployed, scaled, and updated independently.


**Technology Agnostic**
Services can be built using different programming languages or frameworks.


**Decentralized Data Management**
Each service manages its own database, avoiding shared schemas.


**Fault Isolation**
Failure in one service doesn‚Äôt affect the entire system.


**Scalability**
Services can be scaled individually based on demand.



**üõ†Ô∏è Example: E-Commerce Application**

MicroserviceResponsibilityUser ServiceHandles user registration, login, profileProduct ServiceManages product catalog and inventoryOrder ServiceProcesses orders and paymentsNotification ServiceSends emails, SMS, push notifications
Each service exposes its own API and communicates via API Gateway, SNS/SQS, or EventBridge.

**üöÄ Microservices in Node.js + AWS**

Yes, I have used microservice architecture in Node.js projects deployed on AWS. Here's how:

**‚úÖ Technologies Used**

Node.js ‚Äì For building lightweight REST APIs.

AWS Lambda ‚Äì Serverless compute for each microservice.

Amazon API Gateway ‚Äì Routing requests to appropriate services.

Amazon DynamoDB / RDS ‚Äì Per-service databases.

Amazon SQS / SNS ‚Äì For asynchronous communication.

AWS Step Functions ‚Äì For orchestrating workflows across services.

AWS CloudWatch ‚Äì For monitoring and logging.

**üì¶ Deployment Strategy**

Each microservice is packaged and deployed independently using:

AWS SAM / Serverless Framework / Terraform

CI/CD pipelines with GitHub Actions or AWS CodePipeline


**üîí Security & Isolation**

- IAM roles scoped per service

- API Gateway with Cognito for authentication

- VPC isolation for sensitive services

**Ques : Can you explain the difference between a monolithic architecture and microservices architecture?**

**üß© Monolithic Architecture**

A monolithic architecture is a traditional software design where the entire application is built as a single, unified unit.

‚úÖ Characteristics:

Single codebase and deployment unit
Shared database across all modules
Tight coupling between components
Easier to develop and test initially

**‚ùå Limitations:**

Difficult to scale individual components
Harder to maintain as the codebase grows
Deployment of one feature affects the entire app
Limited fault isolation

üõ†Ô∏è Example:
An e-commerce app where user management, product catalog, order processing, and payment logic are all part of one Node.js Express server and one database.

**üß± Microservices Architecture**

A microservices architecture breaks the application into smaller, independent services that communicate over APIs.
‚úÖ Characteristics:

Each service handles a specific business function

Independent deployment and scaling

Services can use different languages and databases

Better fault isolation and maintainability

üõ†Ô∏è Example:
**An e-commerce app with:**

- User Service (Node.js + DynamoDB)

- Product Service (Node.js + MongoDB)

- Order Service (Node.js + RDS)

- Notification Service (Node.js + SNS)

Each service is deployed independently using AWS Lambda, ECS, or Fargate, and communicates via API Gateway or SQS.
