What is the role of an API Gateway in a microservices architecture?

When should 4xx and 5xx HTTP status codes be used in REST API design?

**üß± What is Microservice-Based Architecture?** : 
Microservice architecture is a design pattern where an application is broken down into a collection of small, loosely coupled, independently deployable services. Each service is responsible for a specific business capability and communicates with other services via APIs (typically REST or messaging queues).

**‚úÖ Key Characteristics**


**Independent Deployment**
Each microservice can be deployed, scaled, and updated independently.


**Technology Agnostic**
Services can be built using different programming languages or frameworks.


**Decentralized Data Management**
Each service manages its own database, avoiding shared schemas.


**Fault Isolation**
Failure in one service doesn‚Äôt affect the entire system.


**Scalability**
Services can be scaled individually based on demand.

Each service exposes its own API and communicates via API Gateway, SNS/SQS, or EventBridge.

**üöÄ Microservices in Node.js + AWS**

Yes, I have used microservice architecture in Node.js projects deployed on AWS. Here's how:

**‚úÖ Technologies Used**

Node.js ‚Äì For building lightweight REST APIs.

AWS Lambda ‚Äì Serverless compute for each microservice.

Amazon API Gateway ‚Äì Routing requests to appropriate services.

Amazon DynamoDB / RDS ‚Äì Per-service databases.

Amazon SQS / SNS ‚Äì For asynchronous communication.

AWS Step Functions ‚Äì For orchestrating workflows across services.

AWS CloudWatch ‚Äì For monitoring and logging.

**üì¶ Deployment Strategy**

Each microservice is packaged and deployed independently using:

AWS SAM / Serverless Framework / Terraform

CI/CD pipelines with GitHub Actions or AWS CodePipeline


**üîí Security & Isolation**

- IAM roles scoped per service

- API Gateway with Cognito for authentication

- VPC isolation for sensitive services
