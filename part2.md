**Ques:	where you are more comfortable with backend or frontend?**

I am more comfortable with backend development, especially using Node.js. I enjoy designing and implementing REST APIs, managing business logic, and integrating with databases and external services. My focus is on writing clean, scalable, and secure backend code, implementing best practices like proper error handling, testing (unit, integration, functional), and optimizing performance.
I also have experience deploying backend services using CI/CD pipelines and monitoring them in production. While I can work with frontend when needed, my strength and passion lie in building robust backend systems.

**Ques. 	What is your approach when initiating a new project from scratch?**

When I initiate a new project from scratch, I follow a structured approach to ensure scalability, maintainability, and clarity:

✅ 1. Understand Requirements

Gather functional and non-functional requirements.
Identify core modules (e.g., User, Product, Billing for e-commerce).
Define tech stack (Node.js, Express, MongoDB, AWS services if needed).


✅ 2. Design Architecture

Choose monolith vs microservices based on complexity.
Define API contracts (request/response schema).
Plan database schema and relationships.
Decide on authentication strategy (JWT, OAuth, Cognito).


✅ 3. Set Up Project Structure

Create a clean folder structure

```

/src
  /controllers
  /services
  /models
  /routes
  /middlewares
  /tests

```


Add config files for environment variables (.env).

✅ 4. Implement Best Practices

Add ESLint + Prettier for code quality.
Configure Husky pre-commit hooks for linting and tests.
Set up Git branching strategy (feature branches, PR reviews).


✅ 5. Start with Core Modules

Build User module first (auth, CRUD).
Add Product and Billing after base setup.
Write unit tests for each function (TDD if possible).


✅ 6. Integrate CI/CD

Use GitHub Actions or Jenkins:

Run unit tests on every commit.
Run integration + functional tests on PR.
Deploy to staging after tests pass.




✅ 7. Add Observability

Implement logging (Winston).
Add monitoring (PM2, CloudWatch if AWS).
Set up error tracking (Sentry).


✅ 8. Documentation

Create README with setup instructions.
Add Swagger/OpenAPI for API documentation.
