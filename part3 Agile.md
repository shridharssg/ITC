**Agile Process in Short**

**Requirement Gathering** – Collect high-level requirements from stakeholders.

**Product Backlog Creation** – List and prioritize all features and tasks.

**Sprint Planning** – Select backlog items for the sprint and estimate effort.

**Task Breakdown** – Split stories into smaller, actionable tasks.

**Development** – Implement features iteratively with continuous integration.

**Daily Stand-ups** – Short meetings to track progress and remove blockers.

**Testing** – Validate functionality through unit, integration, and acceptance tests.

**Sprint Review** – Demonstrate completed work to stakeholders for feedback.

**Sprint Retrospective** – Analyze what went well and what can improve.

**Release/Deployment** – Deliver working software incrementally to production.


✅ **Think of it as Plan → Build → Test → Review → Improve → Release.**



✅ **Jira Issue Types**

**Epic**

A large feature or initiative that spans multiple sprints.

Example: “Implement Payment Gateway Integration.”


**Story**

A user requirement that delivers value and can be completed in one sprint.

Example: “As a user, I want to pay using credit card.”


**Task**

A technical or non-functional activity (not directly user-facing).

Example: “Set up AWS Lambda for payment service.”


**Sub-task**

A smaller piece of work under a Story or Task.

Example: “Write unit tests for payment Lambda function.”



**Bug**

A defect or issue that needs fixing.

Example: “Payment page crashes when selecting PayPal.”




✅ **Epic → Stories → Tasks → Sub-tasks → Bugs.**

**Ques : What was your role while doing team management?**

My role in team management involved both technical leadership and people coordination. Specifically:

**Task Allocation & Planning** – I broke down project requirements into manageable tasks and assigned them based on team members’ strengths.

**Mentoring & Guidance** – I helped junior developers with code reviews, best practices, and troubleshooting.

**Ensuring Timely Delivery** – I monitored progress, managed blockers, and coordinated with stakeholders to keep timelines on track.

**Knowledge Sharing** – Organized sessions to keep the team updated on new technologies and tools.

**Collaboration & Communication** – Acted as a bridge between the team and management, ensuring clarity in requirements and expectations.

**Ques : What is Agile? How you do estimations and Backlog grooming?**

Agile is a software development methodology focused on iterative progress, collaboration, and flexibility. 
It breaks work into small increments called sprints, allowing teams to adapt quickly to changes and deliver value continuously.

**How I do Estimations:**

We use Story Points to estimate effort based on complexity, not time.

team discusses each user story and agrees on an estimate.

**Consider factors like:**

- Complexity of logic
- Dependencies
- Testing effort
- Integration with other systems

**Backlog Grooming (Refinement):**

Regular sessions (usually once per sprint) to:

- Review and prioritize backlog items.

- Break down large stories into smaller, actionable tasks.

- Ensure acceptance criteria are clear.

- Remove outdated or irrelevant items.


Collaborate with Product Owner to confirm priorities and clarify requirements.

**Ques : What Agile ceremonies do you practice, and how do they contribute to the project’s success?**

In our Agile process, we follow key ceremonies that ensure collaboration and transparency:

**Daily Stand-ups** – Short meetings to share progress, blockers, and plans. This keeps everyone aligned and helps resolve issues quickly.

**Sprint Planning** – We define the sprint goal, prioritize backlog items, and estimate tasks. This ensures clarity and realistic commitments.

**Backlog Refinement** – Regular sessions to groom the backlog, clarify requirements, and break down stories. This prevents surprises during planning.

**Sprint Review** – Demonstrating completed work to stakeholders for feedback. This ensures we deliver value and adapt to changing needs.

**Sprint Retrospective** – Discuss what went well, what can improve, and actionable steps. This drives continuous improvement in team performance.

**Ques : How do you estimate tasks in Agile projects? What challenges do you face during estimation, and how do you address them?**

How I estimate tasks:

We use story points or time-based estimation during Sprint Planning.

I break down user stories into smaller tasks and consider factors like complexity, dependencies, and team experience.

**Techniques I use include:**
- Relative Estimation (comparing tasks to previously completed ones).

Challenges faced:

- Unclear Requirements – Leads to inaccurate estimates.
  
**Solution**: I ensure proper grooming sessions and clarify acceptance criteria before estimation.

- Dependencies on Other Teams – Can delay delivery.
  
**Solution**: Identify dependencies early and add buffer time.

- New Technology or Unknown Complexity – Hard to predict effort.
  
**Solution:** Do a quick spike (research/prototype) before final estimation.

- Over/Under Estimation – Impacts sprint commitments.
  
**Solution:** Use historical velocity and adjust estimates based on past sprints.

**Ques : What techniques do you use to improve sprint velocity, and how do you sustain it over time?**

To improve sprint velocity, I focus on three things: clarity, automation, and learning.”

**Clarity** → Well-groomed backlog, clear acceptance criteria, and breaking big stories into smaller tasks.

**Automation** → CI/CD pipelines and automated testing to reduce manual effort.

**Learning** → Regular retrospectives and knowledge-sharing to improve estimation and remove blockers.

**To sustain it:**

Track historical velocity, avoid overcommitment, and keep improving through retrospectives.

**Ques : Suppose you give story points but are unable to complete the task in that time. How do you represent it?**

In Agile, story points represent relative effort, not exact time, so sometimes tasks take longer than expected. If we can’t complete a story within the sprint:

**Update the Sprint Board** – Move the incomplete story to the next sprint or backlog.

**Document the Reason** – Add notes in Jira or the tracking tool explaining why (e.g., unexpected complexity, dependency delays).

**Communicate Early** – Inform the Scrum Master and Product Owner during Daily Stand-ups so they can adjust priorities.

**Retrospective Analysis** – During the sprint retrospective, analyze why the estimate was off and improve future estimation (e.g., break down stories better, do spikes for unknowns).

The goal is transparency and continuous improvement, not hiding the issue.
