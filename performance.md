**Ques : Performance optimization techniques**

🚀 Optimizing Performance in Node.js Applications on AWS
Improving performance in a Node.js application deployed on AWS involves both application-level efficiency and infrastructure-level scalability. Below are best practices to ensure high performance, reliability, and cost-effectiveness.

**✅ Node.js Application-Level Optimizations**

1. Use Asynchronous Programming

Avoid blocking operations.
Use async/await or Promises for non-blocking I/O.

2. Optimize Middleware and Routing

Use lightweight middleware.
Avoid unnecessary parsing (e.g., body-parser for GET requests).

3. Enable Compression

Use compression middleware (e.g., compression) to reduce response size.

4. Use Caching

Use in-memory caching with Redis or Node-cache.
Cache frequent DB queries or API responses.

5. Limit Payload Size

Avoid sending large JSON responses.
Use pagination for large datasets.

6. Use Environment-Specific Logging

Avoid verbose logging in production.
Use tools like Winston or Pino with log levels.

7. Avoid Memory Leaks

Monitor heap usage.
Use tools like clinic.js, heapdump, or node-inspect.


**✅ AWS Infrastructure-Level Optimizations**

1. Use AWS Lambda Efficiently

Keep function size small.
Avoid cold starts using Provisioned Concurrency.
Use Lambda Layers for shared dependencies.

2. Optimize API Gateway

Enable caching for GET endpoints.
Use HTTP APIs for lower latency and cost.

3. Use DynamoDB or Aurora Serverless

Choose DynamoDB for high-speed NoSQL access.
Use Aurora Serverless v2 for scalable relational workloads.

4. Enable Auto-Scaling

Use Application Load Balancer (ALB) with EC2 Auto Scaling Groups or Fargate.

5. Use CloudFront CDN

Cache static and dynamic content at edge locations.
Reduce latency for global users.

6. Monitor with CloudWatch

Set up metrics, logs, and alarms.
Use AWS X-Ray for tracing and debugging performance bottlenecks.

7. Use S3 for Static Assets

Host frontend or static files in S3 with CloudFront.
Reduce load on backend services

**Tools for Performance Testing**

Artillery – Load testing for APIs.

Apache JMeter – Performance testing for web apps.

AWS X-Ray – Distributed tracing for Lambda and API Gateway.

New Relic / Datadog – Full-stack monitoring and APM.

**Ques : How do you retrieve and process large files (e.g., ~10 GB) stored in Amazon S3?**

Processing large files from Amazon S3 requires memory-efficient techniques to avoid timeouts, memory overflows, and performance bottlenecks.

✅ Recommended Techniques

**1. Stream the File Instead of Downloading Entirely**
Use S3 object streaming with Node.js to read the file in chunks.

const AWS = require('aws-sdk');
const s3 = new AWS.S3();

const params = {
  Bucket: 'your-bucket-name',
  Key: 'large-file.csv'
};

const s3Stream = s3.getObject(params).createReadStream();

s3Stream.on('data', (chunk) => {
  // Process chunk here
});

s3Stream.on('end', () => {
  console.log('File processing complete.');
});

s3Stream.on('error', (err) => {
  console.error('Error reading file:', err);
});

**2. Use AWS Lambda with S3 Event + AWS S3 Select (for partial reads)**

If you only need specific rows or columns from a large CSV/JSON file, use S3 Select to query parts of the file.

const params = {
  Bucket: 'your-bucket-name',
  Key: 'large-file.csv',
  ExpressionType: 'SQL',
  Expression: 'SELECT * FROM S3Object WHERE column_name = \'value\'',
  InputSerialization: {
    CSV: {
      FileHeaderInfo: 'USE'
    }
  },
  OutputSerialization: {
    JSON: {}
  }
};

s3.selectObjectContent(params, (err, data) => {
  if (err) throw err;
  // Handle streamed response
});

3. Use AWS Data Pipeline or AWS Glue for ETL
For structured data (CSV, JSON, Parquet), use AWS Glue or Data Pipeline to process and transform large files.

Schedule jobs to extract, transform, and load (ETL) data.
Store processed results in S3, DynamoDB, or Redshift.


4. Use AWS EC2 or AWS Batch for Heavy Processing
If the file is too large for Lambda (max 10 GB temp storage), use:

EC2 with EBS volumes for custom processing.
AWS Batch for parallel processing of large datasets.


5. Use Multipart Download for Parallel Processing
Split the file into parts and download/process them concurrently.

**Best Practices**

Use streams to avoid loading entire file into memory.

Monitor memory usage and set appropriate limits.

Use CloudWatch Logs and X-Ray for performance tracing.

Use S3 Transfer Acceleration for faster downloads across regions.
