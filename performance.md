**Ques : Performance optimization techniques**

ðŸš€ Optimizing Performance in Node.js Applications on AWS
Improving performance in a Node.js application deployed on AWS involves both application-level efficiency and infrastructure-level scalability. Below are best practices to ensure high performance, reliability, and cost-effectiveness.

**âœ… Node.js Application-Level Optimizations**

1. Use Asynchronous Programming

Avoid blocking operations.
Use async/await or Promises for non-blocking I/O.

2. Optimize Middleware and Routing

Use lightweight middleware.
Avoid unnecessary parsing (e.g., body-parser for GET requests).

3. Enable Compression

Use compression middleware (e.g., compression) to reduce response size.

4. Use Caching

Use in-memory caching with Redis or Node-cache.
Cache frequent DB queries or API responses.

5. Limit Payload Size

Avoid sending large JSON responses.
Use pagination for large datasets.

6. Use Environment-Specific Logging

Avoid verbose logging in production.
Use tools like Winston or Pino with log levels.

7. Avoid Memory Leaks

Monitor heap usage.
Use tools like clinic.js, heapdump, or node-inspect.


**âœ… AWS Infrastructure-Level Optimizations**

1. Use AWS Lambda Efficiently

Keep function size small.
Avoid cold starts using Provisioned Concurrency.
Use Lambda Layers for shared dependencies.

2. Optimize API Gateway

Enable caching for GET endpoints.
Use HTTP APIs for lower latency and cost.

3. Use DynamoDB or Aurora Serverless

Choose DynamoDB for high-speed NoSQL access.
Use Aurora Serverless v2 for scalable relational workloads.

4. Enable Auto-Scaling

Use Application Load Balancer (ALB) with EC2 Auto Scaling Groups or Fargate.

5. Use CloudFront CDN

Cache static and dynamic content at edge locations.
Reduce latency for global users.

6. Monitor with CloudWatch

Set up metrics, logs, and alarms.
Use AWS X-Ray for tracing and debugging performance bottlenecks.

7. Use S3 for Static Assets

Host frontend or static files in S3 with CloudFront.
Reduce load on backend services

**Tools for Performance Testing**

Artillery â€“ Load testing for APIs.

Apache JMeter â€“ Performance testing for web apps.

AWS X-Ray â€“ Distributed tracing for Lambda and API Gateway.

New Relic / Datadog â€“ Full-stack monitoring and APM.
